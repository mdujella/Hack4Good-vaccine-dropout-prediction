# Hack4Good-vaccine-dropout-prediction

Part of a project for the [Hack4Good](https://www.analytics-club.org/hack4good) program (organized by [Analytics Club ETH](https://www.analytics-club.org/)), in collaboration with [TdH](https://www.tdh.org/en). The aim of the project was to use data about children (coming from health consultations) to predict which children are likely to drop out of the vaccine program.
